# My first Go WebApp

## What's in here?

This is my first attempt at a go web app, and it's hopefully going to be cool once I've figured out what exactly I want to do!

## Initial Roadmap
The most recent goal is to create an authentication backend. CRUD users, and store the data in a PostgreSQL DB.
The auth backend should hash passwords and generate tokens (and keep track of them). I will keep updating the README as progress happens! 

As of Nov 7 2019, the plan is to develop this as an authentication backend made completely in go, with the emphasis of having the smallest amount of dependencies possible (and almost exclusively using official Golang documentaion)
